#TODO
 - sqlite3
 - collect all files info(file path,hash,size,stat) into a txt file
 - non-media files index and backup:
   - sidecar: .AAE, 
 - verify backup'd file integrity: check hash with original
 - cleanup files with name like "_xxxxx" md5sum, prefer the simple name
 - ? preserve info of the folders containing photos: context, time, place, situation, persons..
 - timezone of a file with no tzone in meta should be explicitly CHINA, not UTC, for example, 11mike.m4a
